Method: Cross-sectional study in 50 vulnerable dyads, who were registered in a family health care center (Metropolitan Region, Chile; 2012). After the informed consent, mothers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. A correspondence analysis model was applied. Results: The invisibility of social vulnerability estimated for mothers (92.0\%) and children (86.0\%), and a better access was observed to universal services by children and to specific services by mothers. Conclusion: The invisibility of vulnerability limits the opportunities of social protection for disadvantaged groups. Therefore, public policy does not correct social inequalities, which deserve attention by the public health managers in Chile. DESCRIPTORS: Social vulnerability. Public policy. Risk groups.

  abstract = {The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development clearly recognizes that poverty is more than just the lack of a sufficient amount of income. However, some scholars argue that an income-based measure of poverty can sufficiently capture poverty in other dimensions. Unfortunately, the available international indicators of multidimensional poverty suffer from several weaknesses and cannot be directly compared with monetary measures of poverty. This paper provides two main contributions to the literature on poverty measurement and analysis. First, it proposes a theoretically and methodologically sound indicator of multidimensional poverty, called the Global Correlation Sensitive Poverty Index (G-CSPI), which addresses most of the problems present in other poverty indicators. Thanks to the massive I2D2 database of harmonized household surveys, the G-CSPI was calculated for more than 500 surveys, and the results show that it is stable and robust. Second, for the first time we were able to conduct a comparative analysis between income and multidimensional poverty, relying on the same dataset to calculate both. Previous cross-country evidence was based on very different surveys used for the computation of income and multidimensional poverty and even conducted in different years. Building on recent data for 92 countries, our analysis shows that the headcount ratio of extreme monetary poverty (USD1.90) is highly correlated with that of the G-CSPI, but that the relationship is clearly non-linear. Thus, we provided the first empirical evidence of the fact that income poverty is not a sufficiently good proxy for multidimensional poverty.},

  abstract = {Abstract             For most of the history of prejudice research, negativity has been treated as its emotional and cognitive signature, a conception that continues to dominate work on the topic. By this definition, prejudice occurs when we dislike or derogate members of other groups. Recent research, however, has highlighted the need for a more nuanced and ``inclusive'' (Eagly 2004) perspective on the role of intergroup emotions and beliefs in sustaining discrimination. On the one hand, several independent lines of research have shown that unequal intergroup relations are often marked by attitudinal complexity, with positive responses such as affection and admiration mingling with negative responses such as contempt and resentment. Simple antipathy is the exception rather than the rule. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that nurturing bonds of affection between the advantaged and the disadvantaged sometimes entrenches rather than disrupts wider patterns of discrimination. Notably, prejudice reduction interventions may have ironic effects on the political attitudes of the historically disadvantaged, decreasing their perceptions of injustice and willingness to engage in collective action to transform social inequalities.             These developments raise a number of important questions. Has the time come to challenge the assumption that negative evaluations are inevitably the cognitive and affective hallmarks of discrimination? Is the orthodox concept of prejudice in danger of side-tracking, if not obstructing, progress towards social justice in a fuller sense? What are the prospects for reconciling a prejudice reduction model of change, designed to get people to like one another more, with a collective action model of change, designed to ignite struggles to achieve intergroup equality?},

The former covers individual income, while the latter also includes corporate undistributed profits, which affects both levels and trends. The fiscal-income estimates start with low levels and a decreasing trend over the 1960s. They then increase rapidly during the dictatorship years (1973\textendash 89). The series ends with a high, yet slowly decreasing, concentration for most of the recent democratic period (1990\textendash 2017). By contrast, the adjusted series has followed a U-shape since the return of democracy, contradicting the established consensus on falling inequality over the period. Furthermore, Chile ranks among the most unequal countries in both the OECD and Latin American countries over the period.},

This article attempts to explain how these reasons have changed over time in Chile, which has experienced vast economic transformation yet has maintained income inequality. From two national surveys produced in 1996 and 2015, descriptive results show that individualistic attributions for poverty and wealth (e.g., personal initiative) have increased and structural reasons (e.g., unemployment, economic policy) have declined. Latent class analysis (LCA) offers a second reading of the data, demonstrating that the decline of structural attributions is related to an increase in people choosing both individualistic and structural reasons for explaining poverty and wealth. Those changes in attribution patterns are discussed within the frame of cultural and economic transformation in Chilean society.},

Se ha construido una medida que contrasta los principios de distribuci\'on meritocr\'aticos y los igualitarios, teniendo en cuenta que el hecho de que en las distintas sociedades los ciudadanos pueden elegir ambos principios de distribuci\'on al mismo tiempo. Las hip\'otesis son contrastadas utilizando los datos procedentes de varios estudios llevados a cabo en las antiguas sociedades con socialismo de Estado y en sociedades de mercado: el International Social Survey Programme, el International Social Justice Project y el International Survey of Economic Attitudes. Los resultados muestran que en las sociedades socialistas el apoyo a los principios meritocr\'aticos antes que a los igualitarios era menor que en las de mercado, mientras que la tendencia a apoyar ambos principios al mismo tiempo era mayor. Los determinantes socio-estructurales son importantes para explicar el apoyo dado a los principios distributivos, pero estos efectos son menores en las sociedades socialistas que en las sociedades de mercado. Sin embargo, despu\'es de la transici\'on se puede observar un aumento en estos efectos. This paper examines the extent to which people support meritocratic as compared to egalitarian distribution principles in state-socialist societies before and after the transformation in 1989, compared to people in market societies. A measure is constructed which contrasts meritocratic against egalitarian distribution principles, taking account of the fact that people in different societies can choose both distribution principles at the same time. Hypotheses are tested using data stemming from several studies held in (former) state-socialist and market societies: the International Social Survey Programme, the International Social Justice Project, and the International Survey of Economic Attitudes. Results show that support for meritocratic rather than egalitarian principles was lower, while the tendency to support both principles at the same time was higher in state-socialist societies than in market societies. Socialstructural determinants are important in explaining support for distribution principles, but these effects are lower in state-socialist than in market societies. However, an increase in these effects can be observed after the transformation.},

To find out, hypotheses are tested using survey data from the International Social Survey Programme, comparing several state-socialist societies with several market societies both before (1987) and after (1992) the political and economic transformation. Before the transformation, the public in central and eastern Europe was much more egalitarian than in market-regulated societies. The results show that the amount of income inequality that people think legitimate has increased in all countries, but the increase was far more dramatic in former state-socialist than in market-regulated societies.

Analizamos los principios y valores que ordenan las representaciones de la sociedad chilena, adem\'as de centrarnos en las din\'amicas de clase y g\'enero que alimentan las clasificaciones. Este ejercicio permite mostrar que la cr\'itica social y legitimaci\'on de las desigualdades pueden operar simult\'aneamente, aunque en planos distintos.},

Determinants of race/ethnic differences in beliefs about poverty were also examined. 2,628 adults from southern California, including 1,245 Whites, 737 Latinos, and 646 Blacks responded to a telephone survey. Results indicate that significant race/ethnic differences exist. First, Blacks and Latinos are more likely than Whites to view both individualistic and structuralist explanations for poverty as important. Second, respondents' self-explanations have significant effects on poverty beliefs. Lastly, the patterns of effects of several variables that predict beliefs about poverty differ across race/ethnic groups.

  abstract = {Objective. Lay explanations for ``wealth'' have been neglected in research on beliefs about social stratification. This study compares the nature and determinants of beliefs about the causes of both wealth and poverty, with special focus on race/ethnic differences. Methods. Using survey data collected from Los Angeles County residents in 2000, descriptive and multivariate procedures are used to analyze ``individualistic'' and ``structuralist'' beliefs about wealth and poverty. In addition, one ``fatalistic'' belief, asking about the role of ``God's will'' in shaping wealth and poverty, is examined. Analyses test (1) whether race/ethnicity and other social and political characteristics variables shape these stratification beliefs, and (2) whether African Americans, Latinos, and whites differ in the determinants of beliefs about wealth and poverty. Results. Respondents favor individualistic over structuralist reasons for wealth, but favor structuralist over individualistic beliefs in explaining poverty. Fatalistic beliefs are least popular. On beliefs about wealth, African Americans, Latinos, and whites show similar levels of support for individualistic explanations; however, the race/ethnic minorities are both more structuralist than whites on this issue. On beliefs about poverty, the race/ethnic minorities are simultaneously more structuralist and more individualistic than are whites. Social-class identification and self-reported conservatism both significantly impact beliefs about wealth and poverty, and do so differently across race/ethnic lines. Conclusions. Findings support the separate treatment and examination of beliefs about wealth and poverty, and reinforce recent calls for greater attention to ``nonwhites'' in studies of sociopolitical attitudes.},

Here they present the results of their research on the structure, determinants, and certain political and personal consequences of these beliefs. The presentations serve two major goals; to describe and explain the central features of Americans' images of inequality. Beliefs About Inequality begins with a focus on people's perceptions of the most basic elements of inequality: the availability of opportunity in society, the causes of economic achievements, and the benefits and costs of equality and inequality. The book's analysis of the public's beliefs on these key issues is based on fundamental theories of social psychology and lays the groundwork for understanding how Americans evaluate inequality-related policies. The authors discuss the ultimate determinants of beliefs and the implications of their findings for social policies related to inequality. They propose that attitudes toward economic inequality and related policy are influenced by three major aspects of the current American social, economic, and political environment: a stable "dominant ideology" about economic inequality; individuals' social and economic status; and specific beliefs and attitudes, often reflecting "social liberalism" shaped by recent political debates and events.},

Some of these ``structural'' differences, however, are themselves perceptual, and corrected by changed perceptions of the productivity of government and of our historic predecessors, and by a community point of view involving changed accounting systems, as well as by policies of full employment rather than guaranteed incomes. With few institutional changes, these altered perceptions may partially restore political justice to favor.},

On the basis of the existing literature we distinguish five predictors: awareness of the existence of poverty, personal experience of disadvantage, personal values, socio-demographic background and structural and cultural country-level characteristics. Using data from the European Values Survey (EVS) 1999/2000, we assess for most of these predictors the extent to which they relate directly to people's partial ranking of popular poverty attributions. The results of rank-ordered logistic regression models show that differences in popular poverty explanations relate directly to whether one lives in a country with a Catholic tradition and a high level of poverty, their (subjective) experience of disadvantage and personal values. Furthermore, we find that the size of the various associations depends on people's particular choices of poverty explanations. \textcopyright{} 2010 Nordic Sociological Association and SAGE.},

  abstract = {Psychological interest in Meritocracy as an important social norm regulating most of the western democratic societies has significantly increased over the years. However, the way Meritocracy has been conceptualized and operationalized in experimental studies has advanced in significant ways. As a result, a variety of paradigms arose to understand the social consequences of Meritocracy for intergroup relations; in particular, to understand the adverse consequences of Meritocracy for disadvantaged group members. The present research seeks to understand whether there is strong support for the idea that (manipulated) Meritocracy disproportionally affects members of low status groups, and also to understand which specific components of this norm have been successfully manipulated and to what consequences. And this is particularly important given the recent call for greater transparency in how the success of experimental manipulations is reported. Thus, we carried out a systematic review examining the content of different prime tasks, summarizing prime manipulation checks' effectiveness, and analyzing whether priming Meritocracy leads to less favorable orientations toward low status groups. Results across 33 studies revealed that despite the existing differences in the components highlighted, the salience of any of the Meritocracy dimensions facilitates the use of internal causal attributions, negative evaluations and stereotyping toward low status groups, affecting negatively decisions involving low-status group members, particularly in specific domains, as organizational contexts. These results carry both practical and theoretical implications for future research on the role of Meritocracy in intergroup settings.},

Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

We advance conditional effects hypotheses that collectively argue that the effect of residing in a high-inequality context will be moderated by individual income.

In relatively equal counties, we find no significant differences between high- and low-income citizens. We conclude by discussing the implications of class-based polarization found in response to local inequality with respect to current debates over the consequences of income inequality for American democracy.},

  abstract = {This set of studies tests the link between infra-humanization, symbolic threat, and discrimination within normative contexts. In two experiments, manipulating the degree of humanity of a disliked outgroup has an effect upon the discrimination towards it. The infra-humanized outgroup is more discriminated than the humanized one. Also, the perception of symbolic threat plays the role of a justifying factor for discrimination, and mediates the relationship between degrees of humanity and discrimination. Study 2 further shows that this mediation occurs only when an egalitarian norm is activated, and not when meritocracy is made salient. The discussion focuses on factors likely to prevent infra-humanization of outgroups. It also considers how norms may change the role of threat.},

We model rational agents as trying to learn from their dynastic income mobility experience the relative importance of effort and predetermined factors in the generation of income inequality and therefore the magnitude of these incentive costs. In the long run, "left-wing dynasties" believing less in individual effort and voting for more redistribution coexist with "right-wing dynasties." This allows us to explain why individual mobility experience and not only current income matters for political attiitudes and how persistent differences in perceptions about social mobility can generate persistent differences in redistribution across countries.},

The underdog principle, from which it was predicted that egalitarians compared to inegalitarians are more likely to be non-White, have low prestige occupations, have low family incomes, and identify with the lower and working classes, was accepted. The principle of enlightenment, from which a positive relationship was predicted between education and favorable attitudes toward equality, was accepted for England but not for the US. The principle of an egalitarian Zeitgeist, from which it was predicted that younger people are more egalitarian than older people, was accepted for the US but not for England. Two additional important causal variables were found. A sense of personal equity reduces egalitarian attitudes in England more than in the US and may reflect a cultural belief that British society is extraordinarily just because social arrangements result from fair rules of the game. While it is of no importance in England, the cultural belief in monetary success reduces egalitarian attitudes in the US and functions as the belief in the just society does in England.

Besides this, attitudes towards income inequality are influenced by inequality-legitimising myths in a given society. Little is known about how these two factors interact. This study combines these two lines of research and argues that different social strata are more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies with strong prevalent meritocratic perceptions. We expect lower-status individuals (i.e. with a lower income or education) to experience a threat to their group esteem and therefore be less likely to support their society's inequalities in societies with such strong meritocratic perceptions. This hypothesis was tested using data from the International Social Survey Programme 2009 (Social Inequality) on 39 countries. The results show that different social strata are indeed more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies where meritocratic perceptions are more prevalent. Our results are robust for income, but not for education. This suggests that in perceived meritocracies, people regard income as the primary indicator of effort and ability.},

Based on in-depth qualitative interviews with respondents from higher and lower social classes, the paper reconstructs the `moral economy' that underlies popular views of inequality. While respondents agree with abstract inegalitarian principles\textemdash i.e. income differentiation based on merit\textemdash they are concerned with specific instances of inequality, especially poverty and wealth. These are criticized because they are seen to imply intolerable deviations, both upwards and downwards, from a way of living presumed as universal, thereby fostering a segregation of life-worlds and social disintegration. Thus, perceptions of injustice do not seem to be based on the existence of income inequality as such, but rather on the view that economic disparities threaten the social bond.},

In this context, we examined whether dehumanization of low-SES groups has a role in this opposition. In the first study (N = 303), opposition to wealth redistribution was related to denying human uniqueness (e.g., intelligence and rationality) and having negative attitudes toward low-SES groups, more than denying human nature (e.g., emotionality and capacity to suffer) to low-SES groups. Mediation analyses indicated that this effect occurred via blaming low-SES groups for their plight, after controlling for participants' SES and negative attitudes towards low-SES groups. In the second study (N = 220), manipulating the human uniqueness of a fictitious low-SES group affected support for wealth redistribution measures through blame. These results indicate that animalizing low-SES groups reduces support for wealth redistribution via blaming low-SES groups for their situation.},

  abstract = {The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few at the expense of general impoverishment is a major problem in some modern societies. However, there is a general opposition to redistribution policies or to the application of a progressive taxation system. The goal of this research was to explore one factor that might drive the attitudes toward income redistribution: The (de)humanization of high socioeconomic status groups. Previous studies have shown that high socioeconomic status groups tend to be considered as unemotional machines without any concern for others. However, the consequences of mechanizing (vs. humanizing) high socioeconomic status on the interpretation of socioeconomic differences has not been explored yet. We considered that humanizing high socioeconomic status groups might have an unexpected negative effect on attitudes about income inequality and wealth concentration. Specifically, this research aims to determine how humanizing high socioeconomic status groups influences people's perceptions of the group's wealth and preferences for income redistribution. We conducted two studies in which we manipulated the humanity (mechanized vs. humanized in terms of their Human Nature traits) of a high socioeconomic status group. Results of these two studies showed that humanizing (vs. mechanizing) high socioeconomic status groups led to lower support for income redistribution/taxation of wealthy groups, through considering that the group's wealth comes from internal sources (e.g., ambition) rather than external ones (e.g., corruption). These results were independent of the group's likeability and perceived competence/warmth. The present research provides valuable insight about the possible dark side of humanizing high socioeconomic status groups as a process that could contribute to the maintenance of the status quo and the legitimation of income inequality in our societies.},

We examine internal and external attributions of poverty using survey data from the 2006 International Social Justice Project (ISJP). We compare two culturally and structurally distinct regions\textemdash East and West Germany. The results support our hypothesis that the amount of income inequality people perceive as just is related to how they explain the causes of poverty, that is, internal and/or external attributions. Poverty attributions are crucial mediators and explain contextual differences in the perceived justice of income inequality between East and West Germany.},
