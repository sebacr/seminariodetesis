abstract = {During asymmetric war, a state actor often faces charges of disproportionate harm while the weaker, nonstate side must defend itself against charges of terrorism. Because the state actor faces an adversary embedded among civilians, and the nonstate actor confronts an opponent whose military targets are often so well protected that only its nonmilitary targets are vulnerable, it is difficult for either side to fight without harming civilians. While humanitarian law tries to protect noncombatants to the greatest extent possible, too strict an interpretation of terrorism and proportionality may unduly restrict either side's ability to pursue political claims by force of arms. To successfully walk the line between protecting civilians during asymmetric war and allowing each side a 'fighting chance', it is necessary to take another look at the idea of intentionality and the definition of combatants. While intentional harm is the hallmark of terrorism, state armies also bring intentional harm if they expect to glean military benefits from causing collateral damage to civilians. A tighter understanding of intentionality can further protect innocent, noncombatant civilians. At the same time, however, the international community must recognise that not all civilians are noncombatants. Many civilians take a direct or indirect role in the fighting. As such, some civilians are vulnerable to lethal harm while others remain subject to nonlethal harm. Asymmetric war expands the range of permissible civilian targets that each side may attack without incurring charges of terrorism or disproportionate harm. {\textcopyright} 2009 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

To establish this, three paradigm cases of non-revolutionary political violence are examined. The question is then discussed whether revolutionary violence is ever justified as a means of establishing or promoting human freedom and happiness. I state the conditions which must be satisfied for such violence to be justified and argue that sometimes these conditions have been satisfied. Finally I argue that discussions of violence are frequently confused by ideological mystification and attempt to go some way towards revealing the sources of that mystification. {\textcopyright} 1981 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The ability of international ethics and political theory to establish a genuinely critical standpoint from which to evaluate uses of armed force has been challenged by various lines of argument. On one, theorists question the narrow conception of violence on which analysis relies. Were they right, it would overturn two key assumptions: first, that violence is sufficiently distinctive to merit attention as a category separate from other modes of human harming; second, that it is troubling in a special way that makes acts of violence peculiarly hard to justify. This paper defends a narrow understanding of violence and a special ethics governing its use by arguing that a distinctive form of 'Violent Agency' is the factor uniting the category while partly accounting for the fearful connotations of the term. Violent Agency is defined first by a double intention (1) to inflict harm using a technique chosen (2) to eliminate or evade the target's means of escaping it or defending against it. Second, the harms it aims at are destructive (as opposed to appropriative). The analysis offered connects the concept of violence to themes in international theory such as vulnerability, security, and domination, as well as the ethics of war.},

Por lo que voy viendo, parece ser bastante argumentable que la desobediencia civil se jsutifica,porque tenemos el deber moral de seguir leyes justas y la responsabilidad de desobedecer las injsutas. La pregunta es ¿cu{\'{a}}n eso se convierte en violencia y si se mantiene tal jsutificaci{\'{o}}n¡?

Considerando el argumento de Thoreau de que se puede rechazar moralmente la ley, pero sigue respetandose su mandato legal (y por ende pueder terminar en la carcel) y tambi{\'{e}}n el argumento de que la desobediencia civil es un elemento importante parahacer leyes, tiendo a pensar lo siguiente:

Eso significa que si uno quiere que una ley cambie porque la cosindera injusta debe protestar contra ella y desobedecerla (digamos que se protesta contra la AFP), pero tambi{\'{e}}n se acepta que esa forma de desobediencia civil reconoce el poder legal del Estado ¿eso signfica que yo deber{\'{i}}a aceptar queme repriman fuerzas del Estado? Esdecir, ¿los argumentos presentados para la desobediencia civil justifican la violencia hecha por el estado?

¿Con quien peleo?
Con aquellos que creen que la violencia es univoca o que dan por sentado definiciones de violencia. Esto implica qe en la introducci{\'{o}}n y problematizaci{\'{o}}n adem{\'{a}}s de se{\~{n}}alar que la violencia es conceptualmente compleja, puedo abordar el argumento de que eso la hace ser ambigua en su aplicabilidadpara referirse a determinadas situaciones sociales.},

This has generated substantive progress in terms of both theoretical debate and methodological approaches. However, there is a significant lack of research applying non-reductionist methodological approaches that can, at the same time, be grounded in a theoretical approach to violence as a research subject in its own right. This focus section seeks to address this research gap by strengthening the dialogue between different bodies of literature that pursue disparate strategies of delineating “violence” as the subject of an emerging field of sociology. By synthesizing these literatures, the focus section aims to draw upon insights from social theory and recent developments in the sociology of violence on the one hand, and combine methodological approaches that transcend both micro-and macro-reductionist accounts on the other. In doing so, it offers analytical perspectives for coming to terms with one of the most conspicuous shortcomings in social scientific appraisals of violence: the tendency to treat it as a primarily moral or political problem, instead of conceiving violence as a social fact.},

Advances in recording technology including video cameras and CCTV have made it possible to locate turning points and sequences on the micro level. Different scales of violence have different time-dynamics, ranging from micro to meso to macro. These include the following: micro-rhythms (fractions of seconds) of synchronization and dominance in setting rhythms in face-to-face interaction; violence-triggering thresholds (a few minutes or less) in small groups, where boredom makes violence abort; tension-building danger time-zones (lasting a few hours) in organized crowds; revolutionary tipping points (a few days); duration of riots (a few days, but several weeks long if the riot moves from place to place or is intermittently scheduled); mass crisis and hysteria zone of national solidarity, rapidly reaching a plateau and lasting 3 to 6 months before declining; and macro time-forks, where sudden victory is relatively low in casualties, but where a stalemate leads to years of dispersed conflict with high attrition costs.

abstract = {Emotions can drive intergroup behavior, including intergroup violence. We propose that anger, contempt, and disgust (ANCODI) work together in combination to motivate action, devaluation of the other group, and then elimination of their members. We tested the ANCODI hypothesis by examining speeches given by leaders of extreme political groups prior to major events or rallies that either turned violent (e.g., Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany) or did not (e.g., Gandhi's Salt March in India). Three studies assessed these speeches in the year prior to the critical event and coded for verbal and nonverbal emotional and emotional-appraisal content in references to the nemesis group. Amounts of all three of the ANCODI emotions and their precursor appraisals, in text or video, were elevated 3 months prior to violent events, whereas only anger was elevated prior to nonviolent events.

Although the methods used most often in violence research have led to a wealth of important findings, the field is ripe for both reflection and innovation. The purpose of this special issue is to highlight critical measurement issues in the study of violence and to describe innovative approaches that will move this research forward. In this Introduction to the special issue, we identify 3 challenges for the valid measurement of violence-defining constructs, accurately capturing responses in scoring, and diversifying measurement methods-and discuss how the 8 studies that constitute the issue address these challenges and identify promising directions for future work.},

This study analyzes the relationship between beliefs that justify violence and myths about love in two types of cyber dating abuse (control and direct aggression). Method: The sample consisted of 656 young people between the ages of 18 and 30 years (79.5{\%} women). Results: Regression analysis showed that justification of cyber dating abuse was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of direct aggression in online dating relationships. Myths about love were associated with a greater likelihood of control in online dating relationships. Furthermore, the relationship between justification of cyber dating abuse and perpetration of direct aggression was stronger in women. The relationship between myths about love and perpetration of online control was stronger among the youngest individuals. Conclusion: The justification of abuse and myths about love are important aspects in the development of different kinds of online abuse among young couples. This finding has important implications for the prevention of and intervention in these behaviors.},

abstract = {Violence is signaled by a mark of discontinuity, interruption, rupture. The tripartite temporality of violence, with its strong focus on the present, points to the originary violence. Moreover, the violent event is structuring the order of the action sequences in an actual violent (embodied) interaction. The interactional dynamics in violent encounters between co-present actors shapes the specific forms of the experiencing in (and of) the violent interaction. Based on how violence is experienced in an interactive situation, the phenomenon of violence articulates itself according to three coordinates: directedness, co-performativity and de-capabilisation. The outlining of the structure of the lived experience of violence is revealing something irreducible in it. To understand the experience of violence as such, I propose that we accept the idea of violence per se and depart from the idea that the acts of violence are essentially moral actions. The core of the ethical-moral discussion concerning violence should be grounded instead on the moment of conversion identifiable when we take into account the reaction to violence.},

abstract = {The economist Albert O. Hirschman famously argued that citizens of democracies have only three possible responses to injustice or wrongdoing by their government: we may leave, complain, or comply. But in When All Else Fails, Jason Brennan argues that there is fourth option. When governments violate our rights, we may resist. We may even have a moral duty to do so. For centuries, almost everyone has believed that we must allow the government and its representatives to act without interference, no matter how they behave. We may complain, protest, sue, or vote officials out, but we can't fight back. But Brennan makes the case that we have no duty to allow the state or its agents to commit injustice. We have every right to react with acts of "uncivil disobedience." We may resist arrest for violation of unjust laws. We may disobey orders, sabotage government property, or reveal classified information. We may deceive ignorant, irrational, or malicious voters. We may even use force in self-defense or to defend others. The result is a provocative challenge to long-held beliefs about how citizens may respond when government officials behave unjustly or abuse their power.

abstract = {This review of the literature is a cross-disciplinary and systematic analysis of the concept of violence in human societies. The article provides a framework for understanding the phenomenon of violence in such areas as: sociology, political science, anthropology, and philosophy. Two main concept types of violence definitions were differentiated, described, and examined: the narrow and the broad. The narrow definition of violence is characteristic mainly in the political science field, where violence is defined as the unauthorized (illegal, unlawful) use of physical force. The broad definition of violence is associated with sociology, anthropology, and philosophy. The broad concepts are strongly varied in scope and content, including numerous phenomena, such as hate speech, structural and cultural violence, and other manifestations of latent violence, including: iconic violence, media and symbolic violence. Politically motivated violence is a special kind of violence. This is a paradoxical phenomenon - condemned and at the same time indispensable in contemporary political systems and democratic regimes. The review gives rise to different ideas and ways of defining the concept of violence. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Structural equation modeling techniques are used to examine data from a representative sample of the general population and a sample of exoffenders. The findings indicate that experiencing violence while growing up is related to favorable attitudes towards violence against spouses. The experience of violence while growing up and attitudes are related to violence against both children and spouses. The relationship between experiencing violence while growing up and engaging in violence against spouses is mediated by attitudes. The results also suggest that men and nonwhites are more approving of violence towards spouses. However, attitudes do not account for demographic differences in violence against children and spouses.},

abstract = {We develop and validate a scale that measures support for violence in the context of an asymmetrical intergroup conflict between the Chilean state and the largest ethnic minority group in Chile, the Mapuche people: the scale of Support for Violence in an Intergroup Conflict (SVIC). The proposed scale has two dimensions that capture the perceived acceptability of violence carried out in both directions: support for violence carried out by radical Mapuche activists and support for violence carried out by the police in the name of the Chilean state. We validate the scale in a survey conducted using two independent samples: a sample of Mapuche (n1 = 199) and a sample of non-indigenous Chilean respondents (n2 = 195). We test measurement invariance of the scale and find evidence that it is a valid instrument across both samples. Furthermore, findings suggest that the scale has discriminant validity, i.e., it correlates weakly with aggressiveness; as well as convergent validity, i.e., support for violence carried out by Mapuche activists correlates positively with Mapuche identification and negatively with Chilean identification, and the reverse is true for support for violence carried out by the police. We finish by highlighting the importance of measuring support for violence in the context of an asymmetrical intergroup conflict considering violence carried out by the different parties involved in the conflict, as well as the importance of validating the scale considering samples of representatives of both parties.},

abstract = {Under what conditions do people support police use of force? In this paper we assess some of the empirical links between police legitimacy, political ideology (right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation), and support for ‘reasonable' use of force (e.g. an officer striking a citizen in self-defence) and ‘excessive' use of force (e.g. an officer using violence to arrest an unarmed person who is not offering violent resistance). Analysing data from an online survey with US participants (n = 186) we find that legitimacy is a positive predictor of reasonable but not excessive police use of force, and that political ideology predicts support for excessive but not reasonable use of force. We conclude with the idea that legitimacy places normative constraints around police power. On the one hand, legitimacy is associated with increased support for the use of force, but only when violence is bounded within certain acceptable limits. On the other hand, excessive use of force seems to require an extra-legal justification that is–at least in our analysis–partly ideological. Our findings open up a new direction of research in what is currently a rather sparse psychological literature on the ability of legitimacy to ‘tame' coercive power.},

abstract = {Cultures vary tremendously in how they understand violence. We discuss white southern and northern culture in the United States to illustrate the different meanings cultures ascribe to violence and honor. We argue that (1) Southerners understand the meaning of insults differently than Northerners do. (2) They have behavioral rituals that make allowances for this understanding. And (3) they live within social structures and systems that perpetuate these "culture-of-honor" meanings and ideologies. Laboratory experiments, field experiments, surveys, analyses of laws, and records of homicide rates are reviewed. Also, we discuss the legacy of slavery, which legitimized forms of coercive and punitive violence over and above violence legitimized by a culture of honor. Southern violence cannot be understood simply as deviance and lawlessness. Rather, it is a product of a coherent meaning system defining the self, honor, rituals for conflict, and tools that may be used when order is disrupted.},

abstract = {In this thesis the concept of structural violence has been elaborated along with its position vis-{\`{a}}-vis Foucault's theory of bio-power. Considered as an alternative to the mainstream accounts of violence, that only sees violence as a physical, visible, intentional, and intersubjective act of harm, a more comprehensive understanding of violence, involving the concept of structural violence, is championed throughout. The concept of structural violence is put forth as an alternative view for recognizing invisible though equally fatal instances of violent actions. It is then combined with Foucault's accounts of power, and especially his concept of bio-power. It has been maintained that two concepts overlap greatly, especially in Foucault's accounts of neoliberal power. In the last chapter, this argument is supported by examples taken from different case studies conducted by different authors that reflect the violent effects of neoliberal practices. Keywo},

This article seeks to analyse selected examples of such justifications critically through the lens of applied ethics, specifically the justificatory theories termed deontology and consequentialism. These different approaches to justification, and the ways in which they are employed, tell us much about the self-perceptions, ideologies and psychologies of users of political violence. The paper examines whether different sorts of terrorist groups might be said to gravitate towards one particular justificatory mode rather than the other. To this end, the article presents and analyses actual and typical justificatory arguments used by the Provisional IRA, the Red Army Faction, al-Qaeda and anti-abortion militants.},

Leyendo este libro, he pensado que se podr{\'{i}}an aplicar las preguntas de Klugel y Smith al estudio sobre la violencia y adem{\'{a}}s, agregarle algunas relevantes.

1. ¿Qu{\'{e}} es lo que se justifica? (punto de partida)

Respuesta: La violencia

Pregunta subsiguiente: ¿Qu{\'{e}} es la violencia?

Buffachi (2007):
- Violencia como el uso de la fuerza fisica y el da{\~{n}}o
- Violencia como la violaci{\'{o}}n de derechos
- Violencia como la violaci{\'{o}}n de la integridad

*Nota*: Incluir problematizaci{\'{o}}n sobre tipos de violencia. Revisar Heitmeyer y Hagan (2005) de nuevo.

Pregunta a problematizar: ¿El ambito analitico y moral de la violencia se deben considerar juntos o separados?

2. ¿Qu{\'{e}} argumentos/principios se utilizan para argumentar en torno a lo que se justifica? (discusi{\'{o}}n teorica)

Esta pregunta trae dos preguntas implicitas. La primera es ¿Qu{\'{e}} argumentos llevan a justificar la violencia?

Seg{\'{u}}n Buffachi (2007): Hay tres argumentos principales.

a. Violencia para la justicia
a.1 Argumento para la necesidad
a.2 Argumento estrategico

b. El argumento de la identidad
c. El argumento consecuencialista

Seg{\'{u}}n Frazer y Hutchings (2019):

Consecuencialista
Right-based
Duty-based
Por necesidad

Perspectiva fenomenol{\'{o}}gica y Arendt no s{\'{e}} como abordarla conceptualmente

Y la segunda pregunta refiere a ¿Qu{\'{e}} tipo de violencia es justificada y cuanto? 

Buffachi (2007):

- Fundamental Principle
- Principle of Self Defence
- Principle of Reasonable Sucess
- Principle of Proportionality
- Principle of Last Resort
- Principle of Gradual Progression or Escalation

3. ¿Qu{\'{e}} factores inciden en la justificaci{\'{o}}n de la violencia? (pregunta empirica, sociol{\'{o}}gica, aporte)

Dos preguntas subsiguietes a esta pueden ser:

¿Qu{\'{e}} tipo de factores (sociales-contextuales, individuales, pol{\'{i}}ticos)?

¿C{\'{o}}mo var{\'{i}}an esos factores en el tiempo?

4. ¿Cu{\'{a}}les son las consecuencias de esas jsutificaciones? (relevancia)


Otras preguntas relevantes (especialmente en terminos metodol{\'{o}}gicos) pueden ser:
¿Qui{\'{e}}n hace la justificaci{\'{o}}n?
¿Cu{\'{a}}ndo se hace la justificaci{\'{o}}n?},

@article{Littman2015,
abstract = {Why do "ordinary" people engage in collective violence, harming others on behalf of their group? In this article, we argue that the violent group itself, and the identity it bestows on participating members, is an often overlooked and yet fundamental source of motivation for an individual's participation in collective violence. Reviewing insights from social and moral psychology, military history, and public health, we outline how the psychology of individual violent behavior presents a puzzle. For an ordinary person, participation in violence is often an aversive and distressing experience, and yet violent behavior leads to more violence in the future. A better understanding of the dynamics of collective violence allows us to make sense of this paradox. Violent groups can promote violent behavior among members by increasing members' motivation to engage in violence, particularly through group identification and deliberate strategies, and by removing psychological obstacles to violence (i.e., by making violence less aversive). Our synthesis of the literature points to a cycle of individuals' participation in collective violence, in which group identification motivates violent behavior and violent behavior increases identification with violent groups.},

With striking historical scope and command of the literature of many disciplines, this book seeks the common causes of these events in collective violence. In collective violence, social interaction immediately inflicts physical damage, involves at least two perpetrators of damage, and results in part from coordination among the persons who perform the damaging acts. Charles Tilly argues that collective violence is complicated, changeable, and unpredictable in some regards, yet also results from similar causes variously combined in different times and places. Pinpointing the causes, combinations, and settings helps to explain collective violence and also helps to identify the best ways to mitigate violence and create democracies with a minimum of damage to persons and property. Charles Tilly is the Joseph L. Buttenwieser Professor of Social Science at Columbia University. He has published more than twenty scholarly books, including twenty specialized monographs and edited volumes on political processes, inequality, population change and European history.},

This approach regrettably and inexcusably tends to prioritise the agent performing the act of violence in question. This paper argues that we should resist this tendency, in order to prioritise the victim or survivor of violence, and her personal experience, not that of the perpetrator. Starting from an analysis of the devastating impact of violence that characterises the experience of sexual violation and its aftermath, based on the memoirs of Susan Brison (philosopher) and Alice Sebold (novelist), we will then proceed to argue that violence should not be thought of merely in terms of an 'act', but also as an 'experience', the difference being that an act is temporally determinate while an experience is temporally indeterminate. With the help of a phenomenological approach, we will argue that violence has time-indeterminate intended and unintended consequences; these are the ripples of violence. Finally, some of the moral, legal and political implications of acknowledging the temporal indeterminacy of violence will be highlighted.},

@article{Magil2008,
abstract = {The article examines various arguments about whether and under what circumstances political violence can be justified and how these can be employed in thinking ethically about violence. It begins by looking at arguments about the justifiability of violence that draw on major ethical theories such as deontology, utilitarianism and consequentialism. It then discusses more specific considerations and arguments concerning obligations to obey the law, the relationship between violence and reason, and also violence and democracy, and whether our duties and obligations regarding the use of violence are universal in scope or are limited by national, religious, community, and class afilliation. Finally, it considers and makes some novel suggestions about the overall purpose and conduct of discussions about the justifiability of violence in political theory and philosophy. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.
